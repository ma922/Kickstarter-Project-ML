# Kickstarter-Project-ML

Project belongs to year 2021.

Kickstarter is an online crowdfunding platform aimed at helping people get their ideas funded while building a community of fans to support their ideas. While Kickstarter publishes many advice and best-practices articles on their blog, over half of campaigns still fail.

Why does this matter? Well unlike their competitor, Indiegogo, Kickstarter campaign projects follow an "all or nothing" funding model. This means that if a Kickstarter campaign fails, both the project creators and backers are disappointed, as well as the people who did contribute because the project will not be completed in any capacity.

Objectives
Understand the marketplace of Kickstarter including timing of campaigns posted, types of projects, location of campaigns, description of campaigns and more.
Provide insight into attributes that set campaigns up for a higher rate of success to inform campaign creation in the future.
Build a predictive model that allows us to identify high-failure-risk campaigns before they fail and maybe provide supplemental advice.
